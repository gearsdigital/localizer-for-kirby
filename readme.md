# Localizer for Kirby – A plugin to override _Panel_ and _Plugin_ translations.

## Attention

This plugin is still in **Beta** and is likely to change. If you find something which can be improved, please let me know and open
an [issue](https://github.com/gearsdigital/localizer-for-kirby/issues/new).

### Known issues

- No search functionality
- No translations (I know, I know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
- No tests

## What is this about?

This plugin lets you change every localized string within the panel – plugins included. Sometimes you want to change a text to fit your needs better. _Localizer for Kirby_ will
help you to make that possible.
